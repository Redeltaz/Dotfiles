# Dotfiles

All my dotfiles, I used to be on Arch on full DIY config with i3 but I now moved to Gnome for simplicity.
All my old config for dunst, i3, polybar... is still available on the [legacy](./legacy/) folder.

## Installation

Be sure to have at leat curl installed (and your network can reach internet)

Then you can type :
```bash
curl -fsSL https://redeltaz.github.io/dotfiles/etc/install | bash
```
The dotfiles CLI will be installed and usable to manage the config. If an error appear, you can create an [issue](https://github.com/Redeltaz/dotfiles/issues/new)
