# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository. You can find here all the config files I use on Linux systems.
Feel free to steal anything from here, I also stole some configs ;)
I tried to make an environment that is closest to the colors of the splendid vscode theme [TokyoNight](https://github.com/enkia/tokyo-night-vscode-theme)
